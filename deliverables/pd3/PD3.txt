You are to extend the mips module that you created for PD2 with the extra instructions needed to execute testbench source files BubbleSort.x, fact.x, SimpleIf.x, SumArray.x and Swap.x.  This deliverable does not have to be pipelined; that will come in PD4.  Note that source file CheckVowel.x is not included in this deliverable since it includes load byte and store byte instructions (it will likely be included as part of PD5).

Download pd3.zip.  It contains the testbench modules in pd3_tb.sv and the register file module in regfile.sv.  The testbenches have similar structure to the testbench for PD2: they require parameters pc_init, sp_int, and ra_init be declared in your mips modules (as did PD2) and also requires use of the same register file.  A Makefile has been supplied for the group using iverilog.  For the rest of the groups using Modelsim, the previous macro files should work with minor edits.
